Ideas for efficiency...




Vector3.Distance should use sqrMagnitude when possible
Pathfinding, after it is done, should be verified that it does not loop onto itself, and that all the tiles picked are still valid
This allows pathfinding to take as long as it wants... like even like 30 seconds wouldn't break anything whatsoever (and often produce a valid path too)


Fix Conveyor Belts so they allow for any OBJ_LENGTH, as well as any speed


Nothing should be tick dependant
